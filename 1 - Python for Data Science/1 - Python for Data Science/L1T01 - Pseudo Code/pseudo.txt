I submitted a query as I ran into trouble installing Notepad++ whether it was essential but didn't get a response. But hopefully this is good enough! Apologies if not.


1. (struggling with understanding the wording of this one)
request users positive integer
	if the number is positive, record and tell user "enter another number"
	repeat until user enters "0"
Stop requesting and identify largest number 
print largest number 

2. 
request users name
	store input into variable called "first_name"
print "first name", "Hello, World"

3. 
Get integers
Set counter for number of integers and store as variable "n"
Calculate sum of integers and store as variable "sum"
	Calculate average by dividing "sum" by "n"
Print average

4. 
Get grocery list 
Read 
Arrange into alphabetical order (Can it do that or do you have to assign a=1, b=2, etc...?)
	If already bought assign value of "1"
	If not already bought assign value of "0"
Print all products with value "0"

5. 
Get inputs
Read
	Sum inputs and store as variable "S"
	Divide variable "S" by 2 and store as variable "A"
	Multiply inputs and store as variable "P"
Print S,A,P
