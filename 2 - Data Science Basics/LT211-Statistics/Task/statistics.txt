Task 1

1. Median: Will remove the skewness given by the heavy distribution/outliers of
top 10 or 1%.

2. Mode: Categorize the dishes on the menu and tot up the frequency 
occurrence of each dish, then keep the item with the highest frequency (the mode)

3. Mean: Add up the costs of the previous 6 months. Divide that sum by 6. 
That will be your average monthly cost. Actually as you will times it by 6 to 
get the rest of the year total, it will end up being the sum of your spending
this year to date.

4. Median: Median to avoid the outliers provided by the few people
who are spending a large amount. 

5. Variance: You want consistency in speed, not just overall speed. So 
finding the lowest variance will insure you find a provider that doesn't
move too much from the mean value.

6. Standard Deviation. If you find the s.d. you can ascertain the definition of
undercharging or overcharging as being one or more s.d.'s away from the mean.
